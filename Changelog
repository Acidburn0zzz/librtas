    librtas: avoid bashism in rules.mk
    
    Ubuntu has made dash as its default shell (/bin/sh). This leads to build
    being broken on ubuntu.
    More information at: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh
    This patch removes bashism and hence fixes the build breakage.

    librtas: Little endian support in syscalls
    
    This patch attempts to make rtas syscalls compatible for Little
    Endian systems by ensuring rtas call parameters are Big Endian and
    return values are host endian.

    librtasevent: Enable RTAS event parsing on LE systems
    
    The librtasevent library does not work in LE environments. The
    struct's for each rtas event section are defined as a bit field
    to match layout of the rtas event. This librtasevent library
    currently functions by mapping these structs directly the raw
    rtas event that is passed. This works for BE systems because
    rtas events are in BE by definition.
    
    To fix this this patch re-defines the structs that have been
    used to just contain an int for each value in the rtas event
    sections, then adds a raw version of the struct that we can map
    directly onto the passed in rtas event. The raw structs can then
    be traversed an we can do any neccessary conversions to LE values
    in the structs that are passed back to the user.
    
    This patch updates most of the v6 rtas event sections, most notably
    src/fru sections have not been updated yet. At this time there
    are no plans to update pre-v6 rtas events for LE environments.

    librtas: PCI hotplug support vs little endian
    
    The goal of this patch is to enable a little endian process to interact
    with RTAS which is big endian. The rationale is that librtas assumes
    to be passed cpu endian arguments and do the necessary conversions. The
    reasons for this choice are:
    - many arguments are owned by librtas (status, RMO buffer addresses...)
    - nearly all arguments are being used in cpu endian order by librtas:
      if they were assumed to be big endian, we would have to byte swap
      anyway, resulting in an even bigger patch...
    
    Of course, all rules have an exception: the RMO buffer content is not
    seen by librtas, it is up to the caller (drmgr) to do the conversions.
    
    It seems that recent kernels don't have the needed procfs files anymore,
    so this patch only cares about the rtas() syscall based implementation.
    
    As requested by Benjamin Herrenschmidt, the byte swapping should be
    performed in userland AND be careful about corner cases where non
    32-bit values are being passed:
    
    http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/327089/
    
    We cannot boldly convert all arguments in the sc_rtas_call() function.
    
    For an example, let's look at sc_suspend_me() where we pass a 64 bit value
    split across two arguments. If streamid is ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP, then it will
    be reassembled by the kernel as IJKLMNOPABCDEFGH before being passed to the
    host...
    
    As a consequence, we can only convert well known parameters in the
    sc_rtas_call() function:
    - token
    - number of input arguments
    - number of return arguments
    - return status (always the first return argument)
    
    All other values must be converted in the caller. Please note that we
    introduce intermediary variables for return values as we do not want
    big endian values to be written in memory where the code assumes they
    are cpu endian.
    
    As a starter, we focus on the RTAS calls involved in PCI hotplug.
    According to section 13.5.3 of the PAPR+, we have:
    - set-power-level
    - get-sensor-state
    - set-indicator
    - ibm,configure-connector (the RMO part is already covered in drmgr)
    <disclaimer>
    We should cover all the calls, but it requires a huge work and we
    only want to enable PCI hotplug here. So yes, all other calls are
    still broken in little endian... some more patching will be needed.
    </disclaimer>

commit 0d02142ec36e176694c90ab722aedc75c48801a0

    librtas allocates buffer space (required for RTAS call) in the RTAS private
    memory area through sc_get_rmo_buffer() which internally allocates memory
    and protects it by acquiring lock on the allocated memory area.
    
    Locking function :
       At present acquire_file_lock() tries to lock the particular memory
    area. If the memory area is already locked then it returns error without
    retrying.
    
    So when two process executes rtas call simultaneously one fails with
    "Unknown librtas I/O" error.
    
    This patch introduces "Wait for lock to be available" instead of
    returning with IO error.
